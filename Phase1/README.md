# Phase 1 Development

## Simulation pipeline

1. Data generated and visualised in R/Python
2. Data saved as `.jld`
3. Julia read jld data
4. Julia run computation on data
5. Julia saves simulation results in `.jld`
6. R reads output of Julia for further processing

## Simulation Environments

1. Well-specified and convenient environments
2. Misspecified environments
   1. Skew-normal univariate and multivariate
   2. Laplace univariate and multivariate
   3. Student's t univariate and multivariate
